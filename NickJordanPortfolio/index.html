            <h2>The Life of a Content Creator</h2>
            <p>
                I began my content creation journey all the way back in my 7th grade year in middle school. My school provided a game production/programming class that I decided
                to take and barely understand at the time. Fast forward to my sophomore year of highschool found myself at a new school where I joined the Digital Media program
                and the TV Production program. I was an active part of these programs through the rest of my highschool career and even got the title of school new show producer.
                After graduating highschool I decided to study Digital Media at Seminole State College before being able to transfer to UCF with my AA degree.
            </p>
            <h2>Introduction to Web Design</h2>
            <p>
                The last class I had taken at Seminole State College was a class soley based on the intro to HTML and CSS and strangely this was my favorite class throughout 
                all of my time at SSC. I created multiple websites in this class (not very good when I look back on them now) that I had a ton of fun creating. Because of this class
                my original degree planned changed, as I was originally going to go into the game design track of Digital Media but I found more web design to be more interesting.

            <h2>My time at UCF</h2>
            <p>
                My past/first semester at UCF has been the most work I've ever endured in a semester of school. I took 4 project based classes that included Intro to C, Social Platforms,
                Intro to Game Art, and Front End Web Design. As a content creator this semester has taught me so many new things, even while being online the entire time. I've learned
                many art techniques, lots of programming and most importantly I've gained the skill to manage my own time. 
            </p>
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>
                I look forward to the future and what's to come next as my journey as a content creator/web designer continues. In the future I'm planning on learning other coding and 
                programming languages like JavaScript, PHP, jQuery, and Java. I also want to begin streaming and video producing on the side to have a fun hobby that can make me more
                "computer savvy." Website isn't over just yet :) keep scrolling to see my collection of skills and some of the websites I've made so far!

            <!--Web Dev-->
            <p class="skill"><b>
                Web Development with HTML and CSS:</b> I have developed multiple websites and four of these websites are viewable below. The first website is a movie review series
                of the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy and the second website teaches about Pixel Art (both the characters in the websites header are Pixel Art characters created
                by me). Both of these websites were created from the ground up and were created soley based on design to give the best end product to the viewers. The third website
                was created in a team with three other people and myself. This website is an all you need know website for hurricanes and my job was to create the overall layout of 
                the website. The final site is an informational page about an imaginary social media platform.
            </p>
